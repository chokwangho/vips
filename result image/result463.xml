Can you imagine sharing the flight with a misbehaving toddler? A baby is one thing, they don’t understand their surroundings and the high altitudepressure and the noise from the plane’s engines might disturb a baby. But this is a three-year-old child, running and screaming through the airplane taking passengers from germany to Newark, NewJersey on an eight-hour trip! One of the disgruntled passengers recorded the child ’s antics, as the boy climbs on top of the seats and screeches. The plane hasn’t even taken off yet. Many would have hoped that the kid willsettle down for a cartoon or something. He doesn’t. In the original video, posted on YouTube by one Shane Townley with the title “demonic child screams and runs through an 8-hour flight” with the description: &quot;Watch as this kid runs and screams throughout the entire flight while the mother does little to nothing to stop him. 3 years old on an 8-hour flight from Germany to Newark NJ. He never quits!&quot; The mother of the unruly child tries getting “the WiFi going so we can get the iPad going&quot; and even attempts to  calm  the boy down, but the kid ignores his mom’s pleas to be silent and continues on his  rampage , running up and down along the aisle and screaming at the top of his lungs. As passengers disembark from the plane, they can be heard saying how “even noise cancellation headphones would not have drowned out this terror”, with some even suggesting someone call anexorcist! Child addicted to technology screams for an 8-hour flight because his mother couldn’t get the Internet to work, the parents are not paying enough attention! What would you do if you were on thatflight? As much as we feel that the child was screaming for much-needed attention and placement of boundaries, we can't help feeling sorry for everyone on the plane. Parents need some help on how tohandle the situation as love won't work alone. Every child needs boundaries to feel safe, the iPad can't provide this. No less than twice in the video, the baby's mom is heard attempting to enhance the circumstance. She tells the flight specialist, &quot;We should get the Wi-Fi going so we can get the iPad going,&quot; beforethe plane takes off, and amid the flight, reveals to her child, &quot;Calm down, honey.&quot; This video got more them 1M Views on YouTube, and a lot of negative comments especially toward the mom, people were saying that she failed at parenting and that she needed to calm down herchild because no one deserves that kind of torture for 8 hours.

I have been ADHD since I was a toddler and this has nothing to do with ADHD. He needs behavior modification counseling and the parent needs to learn how to cope with his aggressive behavior. As a child I never behaved in this manner at all. People need to stop making statements such as yours with the unfavorable diagnoses that it is ADHD. Stop using this as an excuse for inexcusable behavior. When a child comes into the world...he/she is innocent. How we, as parents teach them is referred to as learned behavior. This child was left to believe that being aggressive in this manner is ok and his mother's Instinct is to use technology as a babysitter instead of learning how to handle the behavior she created head-on...said this psychologist who graduated at the top of her class...ADHD, and all!!!&lt;/p&gt;" SourceIndex="368" TextLen="840" order="16"/>
